Place your logo image here:

Filename: commerza-logo.webp
Path: frontend/assets/images/logo/commerza-logo.webp

If you have the logo as another filename, either rename it to `commerza-logo.webp` or update references in the HTML/JS files.
Recommended size: 400x400 or a square PNG/WebP with transparent background for best results.

After adding the file, reload the site preview (clear cache if needed) to see the new logo.
